Given a set of poll data called election_data.csv with three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate, the challenge was to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates:

1. The total number of votes cast
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes
3. The percentage of votes each candidate won
4. The total number of votes each candidate won
5. The winner of the election based on popular vote.
